        <p>The most commonly known type of physical therapy is rehabbing an injury. Otherwise known as orthopedic physical therapy, this method often encompasses more than simply retraining a sprained ankle or broken wrist. VBNC Physical Therapy uses a holistic approach in treating injuries, aches, and pains because of our deep understanding of the importance of core and spine stabilization. These areas play a critical role in preventing and treating acute or chronic conditions. By getting to the root of the issue, our physical therapy team can help you recover more successfully and efficiently from an injury or surgical procedure.</p>
        <p>We have developed many strategies to help patients effectively recover from a range of orthopedic conditions, including back and neck pain, cervical radiculopathy, headaches, thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), discopathies, joint and soft tissue disorders, and dysfunctions of the hip, knee, and ankle. VBNC Physical Therapy is deeply invested in understanding your unique condition and is able to use leading industry strategies to support your recovery. With close monitoring, routine evaluations, and program modifications, we can ensure your progress and set you up for long-term success.</p>
